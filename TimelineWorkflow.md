5. Move data from input form (responses) to appropriate columns in NewTimeline. 
	- Start and Finish Dates go in Start and End Date 
	- Title or Task goes in Headline 
	- Notes, Further Description, Contacts, secondary urls, etc. go in Text 
	- Primary url goes in media 
	- Task Aim goes in Media Credit 
	- Media Caption can be a catch-all or assigned to something specific
	
6. Make sure your data set is clean: no empty rows, no stray characters in the dates fields, etc.

7. Share NewTimeline - make it public.
8. Go to File > Publish to the Web 
9. Choose 'Start publishing'
10. Copy the link 
11. Go to [Timeline.js] (http://www.timeline.knightlab.com)
12. Paste link into step 3 
13. Preview 
	- if it's good, copy the embed code. paste it where e're you'd like
	- if it's not good, check your data set again 
	- if your data set is good, you might have accidentally altered the setup of TimelineJS Template. Put your data into a new Newtimeline, try again.
	
##All done!
